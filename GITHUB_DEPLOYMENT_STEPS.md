# ðŸš€ GitHub Deployment Steps

## The "Unable to commit to repository" error means you need to set up GitHub first!

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon â†’ "New repository"
3. Name it: `super-recruiter-portal`
4. Make it **Public** (required for free GitHub Pages)
5. **Don't** check "Initialize with README"
6. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Connect Your Local Project to GitHub
After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/super-recruiter-portal.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username!**

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Settings" tab
3. Scroll to "Pages" section
4. Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
5. The site will automatically deploy!

### Step 4: Access Your Live Site
Your site will be available at:
`https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/super-recruiter-portal/`

## Alternative: Manual Upload Method

If you prefer not to use Git commands:

1. Create the repository on GitHub (steps above)
2. Click "uploading an existing file"
3. Drag ALL files from your project folder
4. Make sure to include the `.github` folder!
5. Commit the files
6. Enable GitHub Pages in Settings

## âœ… Your Project is Ready!
- All files are configured for GitHub Pages
- GitHub Actions workflow is set up
- Build configuration is optimized
- Routing is configured for single-page apps

The error you're seeing is just because we haven't connected to GitHub yet. Follow the steps above and you'll be live in minutes!
