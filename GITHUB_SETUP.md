# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## Quick Setup Steps

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and create a new repository
2. Name it something like `super-recruiter-portal` or `toolkit-platform`
3. Make it public (required for free GitHub Pages)
4. Don't initialize with README, .gitignore, or license

### 2. Upload Project Files
You have two options:

#### Option A: Upload via GitHub Web Interface
1. Click "uploading an existing file" on your new repository page
2. Drag and drop ALL files from this project
3. Make sure to include the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file
4. Commit the files

#### Option B: Use Git Commands (if you have Git installed)
```bash
git clone [your-repository-url]
cd [repository-name]
# Copy all files from this project to the repository folder
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - Super Recruiter Portal"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository Settings
2. Scroll down to "Pages" section
3. Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
4. The deployment will start automatically

### 4. Access Your Site
- Your site will be available at: `https://[username].github.io/[repository-name]`
- It may take a few minutes for the first deployment

## Files Already Prepared
✅ GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
✅ Production build configuration
✅ All source files ready for deployment

## Important Notes
- The site will auto-deploy on every push to the main branch
- Make sure your repository is public for free GitHub Pages
- The first deployment may take 5-10 minutes

## Troubleshooting
If deployment fails:
1. Check the "Actions" tab in your repository
2. Look for error messages in the workflow logs
3. Ensure all files were uploaded correctly
